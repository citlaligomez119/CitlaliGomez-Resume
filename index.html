        <div class="subheading mb-5">TFDP Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Citlali Gomez. I am a TFDP major and I'm looking for film-related projects to work on, such as film shoots, costume designing, makeup, post-editing, etc. Mainly, I'm interested in anything that has to do with the film industry.I'm mostly considered a spearhead on all aspects of film production, from concept development to post-production, managing a team of dedicated professionals to create captivating and thought-provoking content. Successfully negotiated distribution deals, maximizing revenue potential and securing a wide-reaching audience for each project.<br><br>

        Currently, I had just finished up many start-up classes regarding the film industry, however I'm more than willling to expand my clientale and my resume on more experience. I have collaborated with industry veterans, learning the ropes of film production, and gaining hands-on experience in various aspects of filmmaking. Filmmaking should evoke emotions and connect with the audience on a profound level. Whether it's joy, sadness, fear, or inspiration, my work is going to make people feel something.  I'm eager to expand my clientele and bolster my resume by taking on more challenging projects. My journey in this field has been enriched by valuable interactions, which have allowed me to learn the intricate ropes of film production. This hands-on experience has given me a well-rounded understanding of various aspects of filmmaking.

        In my view, the essence of filmmaking lies in its ability to evoke deep emotions and connect with the audience on a profound level. Be it the jubilation of a comedy, the pathos of a drama, the spine-tingling fear of a horror film, or the profound inspiration of a thought-provoking documentary, my work is driven by the desire to make people feel something. I believe that the power of film goes beyond entertainment; it has the potential to leave an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of its viewers.

        As I continue my journey in the film industry, I am committed to creating compelling and resonant stories that not only entertain but also inspire, challenge, and connect with audiences. My goal is to be a driving force in the evolution of the film industry, contributing to the creation of memorable cinematic experiences that leave a lasting impact on those who watch them. Whether it's through my involvement in pre-production, on-set activities, or the intricacies of post-production, I am dedicated to leaving a mark on this dynamic and ever-evolving industry.<br><br>

        I have some experience in the theatre department, as well as film editing, production assistant, cashier/server, general labor and fluent in word excel, powerpoint, and word docs. I am also fluently bilingual, punctual, managable, flexible and organized. I'm also an expert at improvising and keeping people on track and in line. Some might say that I'm a passionate and seasoned film producer with a proven track record of transforming visionary ideas into compelling cinematic experiences. With over 2 years in the film industry, I have developed a reputation for delivering high-quality content, managing complex productions, and building strong industry relationships. My dedication to storytelling and a relentless pursuit of excellence make me a trusted name in the world of film production. And I cannot wait to expand more on it.
